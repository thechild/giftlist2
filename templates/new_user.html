<p class="lead">Welcome to Christmas 2012 Gift Tracker</p>
<p>You've been invited to join by a friend who is using the site to plan gifts for you.  Once you create your account, you'll be able to set up a list of gifts that you want, and anyone who is planning on giving you a gift this holiday season will be able to see your list.  You'll also be able to see lists anyone on <em>your</em> list has created, and reserve gifts so that no one else gets them the same thing.</p>
